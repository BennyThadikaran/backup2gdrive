# backup2gdrive
Compress files and entire folders to a zip file and upload to Google drive.
Subsequent uploads will update the same file on Google drive.

### Initial Setup
`$ pip install PyDrive2`

Follow the [instructions here](https://docs.iterative.ai/PyDrive2/quickstart/#authentication) to generate the client_secret.json.
Save the file to a location of your choice.

Open the settings.yaml,
- edit 'client_config_file' with the file location of client_secret.json.
- edit 'save_credentials_file' with the file location for credentials.json. This file is automatically generated by PyDrive2 during authentication.

settings.yaml
```
client_config_backend: file
client_config_file: /home/john/.config/pydrive/client_secret.json
save_credentials: True
save_credentials_backend: file
save_credentials_file: /home/john/.config/pydrive/credentials.json
get_refresh_token: True
```

Lastly, create a text file with all the files and folders you wish to back up.

daily_backup_files.txt
```
/home/john/.config
/home/john/Videos
/home/john/Music
/home/john/Documents/companies.csv
```

### Usage
backup.py takes 2 arguments:
- file path to save zip file
- file path to the .txt file (in this case daily_backup_files.txt)

`$ python3 backup.py daily_backup.zip daily_backup_files.txt`

Upon successful upload, a json file (daily_backup.json) containing details of the file upload is saved in the same folder as the zip file.

The next time, the same command is run, it looks up the json file and updates the Google drive file.

If the json file is missing, a new file is generated on Google drive.

### Ignore specific files and folders
backup.py contains a 'ignore' variable which is a tuple of files or folder names to ignore or exclude.

By default, python venv related files have been ignored.
Edit the tuple as per requirements.

backup.py
```
